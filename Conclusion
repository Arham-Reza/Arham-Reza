# Conclusion from EDA

After the EDA and the visualizations, we can conclude the following (considering the training set mainly) :
1. If we consider both the training set and testing set provided by Kaggle, then it can be seen that there were **63 families aboard** and considering the members of the families, *236 passengers were travelling with families*. But, if we consider the training set only, **142 passengers (approximately 21%) were found to travel with their families**, out of which *80 passengers survived (77.5%)* and **537 passengers (approximately 79%) were travelling alone** out of which, *163 passengers survived (approximately, 43.58%)*. So, **Survival Ratio is greater for the passenger population who were travelling with family**. In other words, most of the passengers, who were travelling alone, did not survive that night.
2. Out of the total passenger population, **577 (64.76%) were male passengers** and **314 (35.24%) were female passegers**.
3. **342 (only 38.38%) passengers survived**. In other words, **549 (61.62%) passengers did'nt survive that night**.
4. Among the survived population 68.13% were female passengers. So, **Sex played a vital role in the survival of a passenger**.
5. Maximum number of passengers were in the age group of 19-35 years.
6. Most of the children survived and also, the eldest person, Mr. Algernon Henry Wilson Barkworth (Passenger ID : 631), 80 years old, who boarded from Southampton, also survived. So, **Age played a vital role in survival of a passenger**.
7. **419 (55.11%) passengers** were travelling in **3rd Class**, which is maximum. **184 (20.65%) passengers** were travelling in **2nd Class**, which is minimum.
8. **Sex Ratio was maximum in 3rd Class**. In other words, *maximum male passengers in 3rd Class were travelling alone*.
9. Out of 38.38% survived population, *39.77% passengers were from 1st Class, which is maximum*. So, **many passengers got their life back for their money and social status**.
10. Among the **233 survived-female passengers**, *91 passengers* were from 1st Class, which is maximum.
11. Among the **468 died-male passengers**, *300* were from 3rd Class, which is maximum.
12. The survival ratio is 1 in case of the female passengers of 3rd Class.
13. **72.50% of the passenger population (646 passengers)** boarded Titanic from Southampton, which is highest among the ports.
14. Sex ratio is also highest among the passegers, who boarded from Southampton.
