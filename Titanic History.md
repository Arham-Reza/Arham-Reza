About 109 years ago, on **10 April 1912**,  the **Royal Mail Ship(RMS) Titanic** started her maiden transatlantic voyage from **Southampton, England** to **New York City, United States**. 

This luxurious "unsinkable" ocean liner was the product of intense competition among the rival shipping lines in the first halh of the 20th Century. In particular, the White Star Line found itself in a battle for steamship primacy with Cunard, a venerable British firm with two standout ships that ranked among the most sophisticated and luxurious of their time.

To take part in the competition, White Star Line ordered the ship on 17 September, 1908. The ship was completed on 2 April, 1912. The Titanic had 16 compartments that included doors which could be closed from the bridge, so that water could be contained in the event the hull was breached. Although they were presumed to be watertight, the bulkheads were not capped at the top. The ship’s builders claimed that four of the compartments could be flooded without endangering the liner’s buoyancy. The system led many to claim that the Titanic was unsinkable.

On the evening of April 10 the ship stopped at Cherbourg, France. On the morning of April 11 the liner made its last scheduled stop in Europe, at Queenstown, Ireland. At approximately 1:30 PM the ship set sail for New York City. 

With about 3327 people on board(according to Wikepedia), including a number of prominent personalities, the luxury ship that nicknamed as ‘Millionaire’s Special’ had 9 Decks(A-G). Her maximum speed was 23 kn(43 km/h;26mph).

Titanic was commanded by the 62-year-old Captain Edward Smith. Throughout much of the voyage, the wireless radio operators on the Titanic, Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, had been receiving iceberg warnings, most of which were passed along to the bridge.

On the evening of April 14 the Titanic began to approach an area known to have icebergs. Two lookouts, Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee, were stationed in the crow’s nest of the Titanic. Their task was made difficult by the fact that the ocean was unusually calm that night: because there would be little water breaking at its base, an iceberg would be more difficult to spot. In addition, the crow’s nest’s binoculars were missing. 

At approximately 11:40 PM, about 400 nautical miles (740 km) south of Newfoundland, Canada, an iceberg was sighted, and the bridge was notified. First Officer William Murdoch ordered both the ship “hard-a-starboard”—a maneuver that under the order system then in place would turn the ship to port (left)—and the engines reversed. 

**The Titanic began to turn, but it was too close to avoid a collision. The ship’s starboard side scraped along the iceberg**. At least five of its supposedly watertight compartments toward the bow were ruptured. 

After assessing the damage, Andrews determined that, as the ship’s forward compartments filled with water, its bow would drop deeper into the ocean, causing water from the ruptured compartments to spill over into each succeeding compartment, thereby sealing the ship’s fate. 

By 1:00 AM water was seen at the base (E deck). As the Titanic’s bow continued to sink, the stern began to rise out of the water, placing incredible strain on the midsection. *At about 2:00 AM the stern’s propellers were clearly visible above the water*. *At approximately 2:18 AM the lights on the Titanic went out*. It then broke in two, with the bow going underwater. Finally **at 2:20 AM, 15 April 1912, the ship foundered as the stern also disappeared beneath the Atlantic** with well over one thousand people still aboard.

Titanic carried only a total of 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch during the sinking. The lifeboats were enough for 1,178 people—about half the number on board, and one third of her total capacity. Their main moto that night was, **women and children first**. The Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived and brought aboard an estimated 710 survivors.

After the Titanic hit an iceberg and began to sink, the band members on board started playing music to help keep the passengers calm as the crew loaded the lifeboats. Many of the survivors said that  the band continued to play until the very end. Reportedly, their final tune was the hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee".One second-class passenger said:

*Many brave things were done that night, but none were more brave than those done by men playing minute after minute as the ship settled quietly lower and lower in the sea. The music they played served alike as their own immortal requiem and their right to be recalled on the scrolls of undying fame.*
