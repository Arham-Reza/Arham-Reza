# Decision Tree Algorithms

There are mainly 4 algorithms that are used to generate decision tree from data, which are :

1. Classification and regression tree (CART)
2. Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3 )
3. C4.5
4. C5.0

Of the above 4 Algorithms, CART ad ID3 are mostly used.

## CART

1. It is used for generating both classification tree and regression tree.
2. It uses Gini index as metric/cost function to evaluate split in feature selection in case of classification tree.
3. It is used for binary classification.

## ID3

1. It uses entropy as metric.
2. It is used for only classification problem.
